# Statistical-Probability-of-Cargo-Theft
Additive and linear regression to anticipate cargo theft occurrences

## OBJECTIVE
The objective of the project is to provide predictability and probability of occurrences to enable anticipation, in addition to assisting in the decision-making process at different periods of the year.

## INTRODUCTION
It's used two statistical models: Additive Regression and Linear Regression.

Linear Regression gives us predictability of the number of occurrences predicted for a predetermined time window. Due to the linearity of this model, we do not use a very long historical series, but only data from the last 24 months and a forecast for a maximum of 30 days ahead.

Additive Regression, based on seasonality and irregularities in the growth trend (non-linear), gives us a probability of the most likely dates of occurrence, and allows us to use longer time series (last 4 years) with a prospect for the next 15, 30, 45 or any amount of days.

## CONCLUSION
When working together, the first model alerts us about the forecast of the number of occurrences for a period, while the second model presents us with the most favorable dates for these possible occurrences.
